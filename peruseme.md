# A Password Generator Script

## Description

For this assignment, our goal was to fill out the javascript to allow this pre-built password generator site to run as predicted. Its purpose was to appropriately generate a random string of characters for a password based on a criteria set by the user. On beginning the process, the user could dictate how long their password would be and whether or not to include letters, either uppercase ('A', 'B', 'C') or lowercase ('a', 'b', 'c'), numbers ('1', '2', '3') or special characters ('?', '!', '@'). After deciding their preferred criteria, the password will appear in the box below.

The deployed and functional site can be found here: <https://spencerv86.github.io/password-generator-script/>

The full process can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/spencerv86/password-generator-script) repository linked here:

## Installation

To install and test the generator, fork and clone the repository from my [GitHub (linked here)](https://github.com/spencerv86/password-generator-script), view the code in your preferred client (I use VSCode), and open the program in your preferred browser to see the generator in action!

If you'd just like to see the finished product in browser without looking at the code, feel free to visit https://spencerv86.github.io/password-generator-script/

## Usage

To generate a password, first click the large "Generate Password" button and then answer the subsequent questions to determine the criteria of your password. With the questions you can determine the length of your password and choose to include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 

An example of the final generated password can be seen below: (Sorry, it's not one of my *actual* passwords!)
